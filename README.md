# Barclay-Hokkien-Bible-SILE-Ruby-Test

Han character & Tailo Romanization version of some words in Barclay's Hokkien Bible. It's a SILE test.

The Han characters is regularized by the character recommendation (an orthography in Han characters) released by Ministry of Education in Taiwan, and the romanization used here is Tailo (Taiwanese Romanization System) released by MoE in Taiwan, too.

Converted with a version in the github repo. of SILE (https://github.com/simoncozens/sile), with my modifications.
